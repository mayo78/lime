## How to use

You need to install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download) and [DevKitPro stuff](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

Once you have Haxe and DevKitPro with DevKitA64 installed, install the dependencies:

(If you are on Linux/macOS, you will most likely need to use `sudo dkp-pacman` instead of `pacman`)

```bash
pacman -S --needed 
switch-bzip2 
switch-cmake 
switch-curl 
switch-flac 
switch-freetype 
switch-glad 
switch-glm 
switch-harfbuzz 
switch-libdrm_nouveau 
switch-libjpeg-turbo 
switch-libmodplug 
switch-libogg 
switch-libopus 
switch-libpng 
switch-libvorbis 
switch-libvorbisidec 
switch-libwebp 
switch-mesa 
switch-mpg123 
switch-openal-soft 
switch-opusfile 
switch-pkg-config 
switch-sdl2 
switch-sdl2_gfx 
switch-sdl2_image 
switch-sdl2_mixer 
switch-sdl2_net 
switch-sdl2_ttf 
switch-tools 
switch-zlib
```

Then just install this fork with:

```bash
haxelib git lime https://github.com/Slushi-Github/lime-nx.git
```

install the dependencies for Lime:

```bash
haxelib install format
haxelib install hxp
```

And my fork of hxcpp:

```bash
haxelib git hxcpp https://github.com/Slushi-Github/hxcpp-nx.git
```

And and generate your Lime library:

```bash
haxelib run lime rebuild switch
```

For now, you must put this in your `project.xml`, otherwise your program will crash when you open it:

```xml
<haxedef name="lime-opengl" if="switch" />
<haxedef name="lime-cairo" value="false" if="switch" />
<set name="LIME_CAIRO" value="0" if="switch" />
<set name="LIME_OPENGL" value="1" if="switch" />
```

and it is also advisable to include this:

```xml
<!--Switch-specific-->
<window if="switch" orientation="landscape" fullscreen="true" width="0" height="0" resizable="false" hardware="true" />
```

And now you can compile your project!:

```bash
haxelib run lime build switch
```

For use the run command, you need to add this to your `project.xml`:

```xml
<config:switch ip="192.168.x.x" if="switch"/>
```

or use:

```bash
haxelib run lime run switch --ip=192.168.x.x
```

If the IP is not set, nxlink (The program that sends the project to the Switch) will try to find the Switch automatically if your console is waiting for it, **but is recommended to set the IP!**

For add more libs (which must be installed in DevKitPro) to the MakeFile (the one responsible for generating the final executable) you need to add this to your `project.xml`:

```xml
<config:switch libs="yourLib1, yourLib2" if="switch"/>
```

## Use with the Lime VSCode extension

Just add the following to your VSCode settings JSON file or the `settings.json` file in your project folder:

```json
"lime.targets": [
    {
        "name": "switch",
        "label": "Switch",
        "enabled": true
    }
],

"lime.targetConfigurations": [
    {
        "label": "Switch",
        "target": "switch",
        "args": [
            "-DHX_NX"
        ],
        "enabled": true
    },
    {
        "label": "Switch / Release",
        "target": "switch",
        "args": [
            "-DHX_NX"
        ],
        "enabled": true
    },
    {
        "label": "Switch / Debug",
        "target": "switch",
        "args": [
            "-debug",
            "-DHX_NX"
        ],
        "enabled": true
    },
    {
        "label": "Switch / Final",
        "target": "switch",
        "args": [
            "-final",
            "-DHX_NX"
        ],
        "enabled": true
    }
]
```

Then the defines for the Switch target (`HX_NX`, `switch`) will be valid in your project.

Lime
====

Lime is a flexible, lightweight layer for Haxe cross-platform developers.

Lime supports native, Flash and HTML5 targets with unified support for:

 * Windowing
 * Input
 * Events
 * Audio
 * Render contexts
 * Network access
 * Assets

Lime does not include a renderer, but exposes the current context:

 * Cairo
 * Canvas
 * DOM
 * Flash
 * GL

The GL context is based upon the WebGL standard, implemented for both OpenGL and OpenGL ES as needed.

Lime provides a unified audio API, but also provides access to OpenAL for advanced audio on native targets.


License
=======

Lime is free, open-source software under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).


Installation
============

First, install the latest version of [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org/download).

Then, install Lime from Haxelib and run Lime's setup command.

    haxelib install lime
    haxelib run lime setup


Development Builds
==================

When there are changes, Lime is built nightly. Builds are available for download [here](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/lime-nx/actions?query=branch%3Adevelop+is%3Asuccess).

To install a development build, use the "haxelib local" command:

    haxelib local lime-haxelib.zip


Building from Source
====================

**DO NOT FOLLOW THIS, USE THE ABOVE INSTEAD**

1. Clone the Lime repository, as well as the submodules:

        haxelib git lime https://github.com/https://github.com/Slushi-Github/lime-nx/

2. Install required dependencies:

        haxelib install format
        haxelib install hxp

3. Copy the ndll directory from the latest [Haxelib release](https://lib.haxe.org/p/lime/), or see [project/README.md](project/README.md) for details about building native binaries.

4. After any changes to the [tools](tools) or [lime/tools](src/lime/tools) directories, rebuild from source:

        lime rebuild tools

5. To switch away from a source build:

        haxelib set lime [version number]


Sample
======

You can build a sample Lime project with the following commands:

    lime create HelloWorld
    cd HelloWorld
    lime test neko

You can also list other projects that are available using "lime create".


Targets
=======

Lime currently supports the following targets:

    lime test windows
    lime test mac
    lime test linux
    lime test android
    lime test ios
    lime test html5
